***UPDATE: Linux Compatibility has been solved **

***This software is currently PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA and has formatting issues with the final output log pertaining to datetime and the header file outputs. 


microCabrilloLog is a small, python based, cabrillo logging software that is mostly compatible with the 2024 Idaho QSO Party log format but still has some quirks. Our end goal is to have an editor compatible with the ARRL Field Day* and other amateur radio competitions. 

The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/joseph-robles-jr/microCabrilloLog.
Pull Requests are welcome.

Prerequisites:
  - An opperating system that supports python3 (Windows(7, 8, 10, 11), Linux, Haiku OS (Yes, really), and many more...) 
  - A version of Python 3 (3.12 works well)
  - The microCabrillo.py file

    Simple navigate to the microCabrillo.py file and execute it with "python3 microCabrillo.py", "py microCabrillo.py" or in whatever way your opperating system executes python       files.
