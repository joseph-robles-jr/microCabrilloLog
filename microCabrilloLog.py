"""
In amateur radio, there are contests that happen to see how many stations you can get in contact with within a certain period. Logs are kept of what you do and will then be submitted to whomever runs the contest. 
These logs are in the form of a formatted txt file in the Cabrillo format. Many of the loggers available are slow, clunky, and often have been around for decades. 
I aimed to build a simple logger that creates these txt Cabrillo files in a terminal program in a way that will require minimal configuration and have little to no bells and whistles. 
This program was designed to create a cabrillo log file for an amateur radio contest known as the Idaho QSO Party. 
This typically includes the date and time, location, state, address, and a record of the contacts that have been made from that particular radio and many other parameters. The result I have ended up with is about 90% compatible with the standard. Some changes still need to be made to datetime but besides that, It works well. 


Example test input:

What is your callsign: K7BYI
Will you be using a spotting network? Y/N: Y
Are you located in Idaho? Y/N: Y
What is your 3 digit county identifier?: MAD
Are you part of a radio club? Y/N: Y
What is your club name (Not Club Callsign)?: BYU Idaho Amature Radio Club
Is BYU Idaho Amature Radio Club correct? Y/N: Y
What is your first name?: John
What is your street address?: 525 S Center St 
Now your City, State, and Zip in that order: Rexburg, ID 83460
What is your country?: United States
Enter Frequency in khz: 14250
Callsign of recived station: KI5TLZ
Input the recived RST report (59): 55
Input the sent RST report (59): 57
Input the 2 letter arrl section or the 3 leter county abreviation: TX  
Are you finished logging contacts? Y/N: n
Enter Frequency in khz: 14355
Callsign of recived station: K5WPH
Input the recived RST report (59): 57
Input the sent RST report (59): 49
Input the 2 letter arrl section or the 3 leter county abreviation: TX
Are you finished logging contacts? Y/N: y
