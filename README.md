***UPDATE: Linux Compatibility has been solved **

***This software is currently PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA and has formatting issues with the final output log pertaining to datetime and the header file outputs. 


microCabrilloLog is a small, python based, cabrillo logging software that is mostly compatible with the 2024 Idaho QSO Party log format but still has some quirks. Our end goal is to have an editor compatible with the ARRL Field Day* and other amateur radio competitions. 

The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/joseph-robles-jr/microCabrilloLog.
Pull Requests are welcome.

To reduce the likelihood of total loss of contest logging date, the developer recommends that you make a backup copy of all contest data before inputting it into the microCabrilloLog software. 

For a mature logging software, we recommend the N1MM+ contest Logging software* (https://n1mmwp.hamdocs.com/).
